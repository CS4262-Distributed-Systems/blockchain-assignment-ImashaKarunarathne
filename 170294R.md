# Lessons Learned
1) There is a distributedledger in the blockchain network which records each and every transaction that happens in the network, using serveral public databases known as the chain. When we consider the Hyperledger Fabric, it has a world state and a block chain. In our example we had six types of assests ,and in the blockchain every block represented the transaction that took place and maintained the state.  
2) Business logic for blockchain network is provided by the smart contracts. In the given Hyperledger Fabric framework, Chaincode is used to implement the smart contracts.
